This repository contains final submission details, of our project undertaken as a part of Vivli AMR Data challenge 2024. Pfizer ATLAS dataset was used for the study. We built prediction models based on both older (10 years) and recent data (2 years) for 19 commonly used antibiotics and compared their prediction results with true susceptibility results. In addition, we have designed a prototype web application which can predict susceptibility patterns. Currently, we have designed the web app <www.findamr.net> for 5 drugs whose prediction models had the best accuracy rates (.csv files are available in the repository).
